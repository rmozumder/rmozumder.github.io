      <p>A summary of my work analyzing kidney metadata from spaceflight experiments as part of NASA’s GeneLab for High Schools Capstone Project.</p>

      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I completed the Basic Level curriculum of NASA’s GL4HS program and participated in the optional Capstone Project. 
        I collaborated with a self-selected team of four students to analyze metadata from OSD-771, corresponding to RNA sequencing experiments on kidney tissue from female Mus musculus mice flown in space. 
        Our work focused on investigating potential links between spaceflight conditions and immune-related responses.

    <!-- HYPOTHESIS & ANALYTICAL APPROACH -->
    <div class="card c4cff5 color-shift">
      <h2>Hypothesis & Analytical Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Based on patterns observed in the metadata, our team developed a hypothesis-driven research proposal. 
        We conducted exploratory analysis, cleaned and summarized metadata, and identified biologically relevant trends. 
        Detailed step-by-step workflow and reasoning are documented in the <a href="building-log.html">Building Log</a>.

    <!-- RESULTS & RECOGNITION -->
    <div class="card c77b2e1 color-shift">
      <h2>Results & Recognition</h2>
      <p>
        Our proposal was selected as one of the top four submissions in the GL4HS Capstone Project. 
        As a result, we were invited to present our research at the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) conference. 
        This experience allowed us to develop skills in data analysis, scientific communication, and remote collaboration.
