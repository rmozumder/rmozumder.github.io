        <h2>Brief Summary</h2>
      <p>
        As part of NASA’s GeneLab for High Schools (GL4HS) program, I completed the Basic Level curriculum and participated in the optional Capstone Project. I formed a self-selected team of four students to collaboratively analyze datasets from NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR).
        Our team focused on OSD-771, which corresponds to RNA sequencing experiments conducted on kidney tissue from female Mus musculus (C57BL/6) mice flown in space. We performed original analysis of the associated experimental and biological metadata to investigate potential links between spaceflight conditions and immune-related responses.
        Based on observed patterns, we developed a hypothesis-driven research proposal, which was presented as part of the GL4HS Capstone symposium. Additional details on our analytical workflow and reasoning process are documented in the building log.
        Our team’s proposal was selected as one of the top four in the GL4HS Capstone Project, which earned us an invitation to present at the ASGSR conference.
